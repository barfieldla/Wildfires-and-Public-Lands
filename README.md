# Wildfires and Public Lands

### Largest Wildfire Locations in the United States from 1992-2020

Over 4,700 wildfires ranking in size class G (5,000 acres or more) occurred in the U.S. over the last thirty years.

These fires affect public lands as they often start on them or spread to them.

The basemap clearly depicts public lands, so zooming to a region shows exactly which fires occurred within the boundaries of areas such as National Parks, National Monuments, and more. 

The wildfire point data is depicted by a flame/fire icon in either red, orange, or yellow depending on the cause classification (human, natural, or missing data/not specified/undetermined). 

Clicking on a fire reveals attribute information including a description of the cause, fire name, discovery date, contained date, and number of acres burned. 

The creation of this map was inspired by the Outside Online article <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/national-parks/2022-wildfires-public-lands/">"How the 2022 Wildfire Season Affected Our Public Lands"</a>

While the web map is heavy on point data, the intent is to display <i>just how many fires</i> that burned over 5000 acres occurred over the last thirty years. 

While some mitigation tactics have been successful, the intensity of these wildfires will continue to grow with the increasing impacts of climate change, the loss of cultural Indigenous burning practices, and drought across the western states.
